The History of Disney’s Stock Price by Markets Insider

Disney stock has been publicly traded since 1957 when it had its initial public offering where Disney stock was sold at $13.88 per share. Previously the Walt Disney Co. issued its first stock through 6% cumulative preferred shares in 1940 where it was traded OTC (Over The Counter). Since IPO, Disney stock has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DIS, it has been one of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average since 1991. Disney’s stock price has significantly risen since its IPO. (read more)
Disney stock has been a part of six stock splits since the IPO,The first post IPO stock split happened in 1967 which was a 2 for 1 stock split. There were two more 2 for 1 stock splits shortly after in 1977 and 1973. The next stock split happened over a decade later in March 1986 when a 4 for 1 stock split took place. The 90s brought two more stock splits, one 4 for 1 in 1992 and then a 3 for 1 stock split in the summer of 1998. All these stock splits work out as 1 share purchased at IPO being the worth 384 shares today.
Disney’s stock price steadily grew during these stock split periods finally going past $25 in 1997, there was slight tumultuous period over the next few years but Disney’s stock price was most hit in the early part of the next decade.
Disney’s stock price dropped nearly 70% of its price value in the near 2 year period between late 2000 and late summer 2002. Which outpaced the drop of many other non-tech stocks which fell about half the amount during that time.
2009 was a tough year for Disney and the market as a whole. Walt Disney Co. reported Q1 profit that fell substantially short of analysts' expectations which sent the stock price to a 10% decline in after-hours trading. Putting Disney’s stock price in the $15 territory, a long way from a previous all time stock price high around $43.
In August 2011 Disney saw it’s stock price drop nearly 14%  in one day after a number of multiple analysts downgraded it. A month later, Disney stock price dropped below $30, which was a year to date low. However from that point Disney, like many Dow 30 members, was part of a huge run up over the next 3 years. Disney stock price broke $50 in 2013, the stock price hit $75 a year later and then finally smashed the $100 ceiling in 2015.
If you had invested $1,000 in Disney's IPO your stock today would be worth over 3 million dollars today.
